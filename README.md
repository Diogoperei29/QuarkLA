# QuarkLA
QuarkLA is a tiny, header-only C++20 linear algebra library for small, fixed-size problems. It provides Vec<N, T> and Mat<R, C, T> with constexpr-friendly operations, dimension-safe templates, and no heap usage. Designed for zero-overhead abstractions that compile down to hand-written loops.
